    <title>Project 2 - Customer Churn prediction using RandomForest</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Project objective</h1>
    <p>The focus in this project is to study the process since the problem understanding until the deployment of the model.</p>
    <h2>Steps of this project</h2>
    <h3>Problem understanding</h3>
    <p>Deep understanding of the studied problem, answering questions like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What possibly is causing the churn?</li>
        <li>How churn affects the company?</li>
        <li>What standards can be seen in the historical data?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Data gathering</h3>
    <p>Collect relevant data from customers that will be used to create the model</p>
    <h3>Pre-processing and data cleaning</h3>
    <p>Clean and format the data to remove bias and improve the model performance.</p>
    <p>Example of cleaning techniques:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fill null values</li>
        <li>Remove duplations</li>
        <li>Normalize data</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Exploratory analysis</h3>
    <p>Exploratory analysis made to discover standards, distribution and bond between the data sources.</p>
    <h3>Modeling with RandomForest</h3>
    <p>Use of the RandomForest algorithm to develop the model.</p>
    <h3>Model evaluation</h3>
    <p>It's used to test the model created with new data to evaluate the precision. Tunning can be made with the results of this step.</p>
    <h3>Deployment</h3>
    <p>Develop a strategy to deploy the model that will be used with new data to make predictions.</p>
    <h1>The problem</h1>
    <p>Churn in Machine Learning context is the predction of when a customer will stop to use a service or stop to buy prodcts from a company.</p>
    <p>You must develop a way to know it without the need of open the box.</p>
    <h2>Available informations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Age: Age of the customer.</li>
        <li>MonthUse: How much the customer use of the band.</li>
        <li>Tier: What license tier the customer has hired.</li>
        <li>Satisfaction: What score the customer answered in a satisfaction pool.</li>
        <li>Time: How long this customer is a customer.</li>
        <li>MonthPayment: How much does the customer pay each month.</li>
    </ul>
